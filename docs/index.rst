Enabling Internet Scale Learning in Robotics
=============================================

Mbodied Agents simplifies the integration of advanced AI models in robotics. It offers a unified platform for controlling various robots using state-of-the-art transformers and multimodal data processing. This toolkit enables experimentation with AI models, dataset collection and augmentation, and model training or finetuning for specific tasks. The goal is to develop intelligent, adaptable robots that learn from interactions and perform complex tasks in dynamic environments.
